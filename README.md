# Welcome to the repository for the study "*Automated, Open-Source, Vendor-Independent Quality Assurance Protocol Based on the Pulseq Framework*"
Neuroimaging research requires consistent image quality and temporal signal stability, especially for funtional MRI studies that rely on detecting subtle BOLD signal changes.
Regular MR system performance monitoring is essential, especially for longitudinal and multi-site studies.
This study aims to establish a robust quality assurance (QA) protocol to promote data comparability across scanner models, vendors, and sites, 
as well as over prolonged periods of time.      
this repository hosts materials for
* data acquistion,
* image reconstruction,
* post-processing, and
* example data with reconstruction and post-processing.
