# All reconstructed images
This directory contains all reconstructed images from three Siemens 3T scanners (Trio, Prisma.Fit, and Cima.X) and one GE (UHP) 3T scanner.           
**Note**: The image package is too big to upload here and can be accessed via this link instead.             

There are four sub-folders for each scanner. And each sub-folder contains (some of) the following sub-folders:
* product_epi_ice: ICE-reconstructed product EPI images.
* product_epi_gt: Gadgetron-reconstructed product EPI images.
* pulseq_epi_ice: ICE-reconstructed Pulseq EPI images.
* pulseq_epi_gt: Gadgetron-reconstructed Pulseq EPI images.
* product_se_ice: ICE-reconstructed product spin-echo images.
* product_se_gt: Gadgetron-reconstructed product spin-echo images.
* pulseq_se_ice: ICE-reconstructed Pulseq spin-echo images.
* pulseq_se_gt: Gadgetron-reconstructed Pulseq spin-echo images.
